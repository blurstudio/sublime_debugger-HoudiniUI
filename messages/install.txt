Thanks for installing the Houdini UI debug adapter.

Please ensure you have the "Debugger" plugin installed. 
If not, please install it and restart Sublime before continuing.

Before using this adapter, a bit of setup has to be performed, 
and your codebase may need to be restructured:

- All your scripting should be done in a custom repository 
  imported by Houdini. For example, let's consider a module
  named 'testfunctions.py' under Documents/HoudiniX.XX/python2.7libs
- In that module, write functions for the functionality you want 
  in your UI elements. As an example, consider a function 
  defined as "def my_function():".
- In Houdini, in the button script, simply write 

        from testfunctions import my_function

        my_function()

Now, all your scripting can be done in testfunctions.py
through Sublime. All that's left is to start the debugger and
select the Houdini UI adapter, set the breakpoints you want
in (your equivalent of) testfunctions.py, and press the button
calling the function in question in Houdini, and debugging will 
start automatically in Sublime.
